NG Reverse UML

The main purpose of this project is to be an add-on, plugin, whatever to compodoc and similar projects to document dynamically JS projects.

We see many documentations of classes and dependencies, but not any (that i have found) of sequence and activities of the code.

It will give a helpfull tool for architects that needs to validate the tests mades, and to the comprehension of the code without the need of opening it.

The project is in its concept based on the logic of ngrev, NGast, AST Viewer and another tools.

Goals:

Sequences:
** Make a Sequence that signals, without try/catch, async/await, and internal variabls, the flow of the component and its dependencies
** Signal the try/catch and async awaits, and variable change
** Link to the another diagram for the guard, service and goes on

Activities:

** Display the flow of each method in its scope
